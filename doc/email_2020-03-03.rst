Hi Rea,

I've adapted the code to try to adjust for the bleed-through of the PI into the
venus channel. This code generates a mask by thresholding the cell wall (PI)
channel of the image. It then applies that mask to both the venus channel and
the segmentation, after which it takes the same measurements as before.

This now introduces new parameters to the code (the threshold for the cell wall
intensity for the mask, and whether the mask is dilated before application).
I've picked fairly conservative defaults for these (i.e. the code will remove
some of the outer edge of each cell, but not a lot), however we could adjust
these.

I've attached results for fca1, fca3 and Landsberg. The code fails in a few
cases (I suspect weirdnesses with very small cells, but I haven't had time
to check in detail), so there may be some NaN type values in the output.

Best,

Matthew
